**How it works**

- The app is a Trivia game where the user has to answer up to 10 questions and if the user wins the game when 5 questions are answered correctly.
- When the game ends the user is directed to the result screen where, in case of victory, the user has the option to share the results or simply click the play again button.


This app is an original project developed by myself in order to further enhance my skills as a developer by exploring different concepts about Android Development in Kotlin.
